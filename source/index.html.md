# Introduction

Welcome to the Engage API documentation.

# Testing

Honeydew can provide a sandbox account and authentication credentials for testing. Email support@honeydew-health.com to request a sandbox account.

# API Rate Limiting (Coming soon)

To ensure our platform remains stable and available to everyone, the Engage API will be rate- limited.
We ask developers to use industry standard techniques for limiting calls, caching results and re- trying requests responsibly.
Calls to our API will be managed by request-based limits, allowing up to 40 requests per minute using a leaky bucket algorithm. You’ll be able to see the current rate using the rate limit header, for example:

`X-Engage-Api-Rate-Limit: 32/40`

In this example 32 is the current request count and 40 is the bucket size. The request count decreases according to the leak rate (in this case 1.5 requests per second), so after waiting 10 seconds the response would be down to 17/40, and 0/40 after 48 seconds.

When a request goes over the rate limit, a "HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests" response is given from the API, this will be provided with a Retry-After header with a value in seconds.

`X-Engage-Api-Rate-Limit: 40/40`

`X-Engage-Api-Retry-After: 1.5`

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
